# SwingGameLibrary-Samples
A repository of samples using the [SwingGameLibrary](https://github.com/davidkroukamp/swinggamelibrary)

**TODO:**

- [ ] `checkCollisions` method should remove sprite objects, sprite objects shouldn't reference the Scene
- [ ] Sprites should have `setDirection` method, directions should be an enum shared by objects
- [ ] Bounds checking should be more explicit in `GameObject` and `Bullet` classes
